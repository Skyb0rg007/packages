      CDash is an open source, web-based software testing server. CDash
      aggregates, analyzes and displays the results of software testing
      processes submitted from clients located around the world.
      Developers depend on CDash to convey the state of a software
      system, and to continually improve its quality.
      CDash is a part of a larger software process that integrates
      Kitware’s CMake, CTest, and CPack tools, as well as other external
      packages used to design, manage and maintain large-scale software
      systems.
