Description: Standard ML of New Jersey interactive compiler
 This project is the old version of Standard ML of New Jersey that
 continues to support older systems (e.g., 32-bit machines). We
 will continue to fix bugs and make minor improvements while the
 main development branch matures. We will also backport additions
 to the SML/NJ Library and other components.
